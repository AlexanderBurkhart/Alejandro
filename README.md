# Alejandro the Self-Driving RC Car

Big thank you to all my friends and family that donated money to help me puruse this ambititious project!

Appearning at the Virginia State Science and Engineering Fair and nominated for the Office of Naval Research Naval Science Award and Yale Science & Engineering Association Award, Alejandro is the Self-Driving RC Car equipped with a low-computing-power, high-performance artifical intelligence that has the ability to drive in real-world vehicular environments. 

The purpose of this project is to show that self-driving vehicles can be made at a low-cost and still be able to mimic a competent driver. One of the main goals is to bring awareness of the effectivness of self-driving vehicles to solve the problem of high fatalities relating to car accidents. The other goal is to provide a modular artificial intelligence for self-driving vehicle systems, so that self-driving vehicles can easily be implemented and used in our society.
