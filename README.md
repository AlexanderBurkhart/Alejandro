# Alejandro the Self-Driving RC Car

## Overview

![](images/Alejandro.jpg)

Appearning at the Virginia State Science and Engineering Fair and nominated for the Office of Naval Research Naval Science Award and Yale Science & Engineering Association Award, Alejandro is the Self-Driving RC Car equipped with a low-computing-power, high-performance artifical intelligence that has the ability to drive in real-world vehicular environments. 

The purpose of this project is to show that self-driving vehicles can be made at a low-cost and still be able to mimic a competent driver. The main goal of this project is to provide a modular artificial intelligence for self-driving vehicle systems, so that self-driving vehicles can easily be implemented and used in our society to combat the high fatalaties from car accidents due to human-error.

Big thank you to all my friends and family that donated money to help me puruse this ambititious project!
